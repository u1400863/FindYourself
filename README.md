Game Title: Find Yourself 

Team Members: Bingkun Han, Ian Weller, and Jake Ramussen

. Game Engine: The game engine we will be using for our alternative game will be the Unreal engine. 

. Game Play: The primary system in our game is the mind meter, and it’s an UI element. 
  If the meter reaches zero before the player finds a way of escaping, they lose. The meter will gradually deplete 
  over time and depending on what the player does the meter can be refill partially or drained partially.
  
Examples of things that will refill the meter or slow the rate at which it decreases:
a breathing exercise the player will be guided through, finding a fox companion to accompany you, reading a positive note.

Factors which will decrease the mind meter:
Reading negative notes, looking at eerie objects, wandering around during the night.

When the meter is low enough the player will begin to hallucinate in which a giant skull monster will chase them,
so they will need to ensure they are self-aware of the mind meter as it will be an element to reflect the anxiety they
feel in real-time.

. OGrES: This game is aimed as a form of exposure therapy for those suffering from Monophobia, which causes those afflicted
  to feel immense anxiety and dread when they are alone. This game aims to educate what Monophobia might feel like for those
  who don’t suffer from it and to act as a form of interactive controlled exposure therapy for those with Monophobia. Find Yourself
  not only seeks to educate what Monophobia is like, but also as exposure therapy for those with Monophobia to better understand
  and control their fear of being alone.
